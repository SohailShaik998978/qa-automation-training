Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC): The end-to-end path of building software—turning a business idea into a running product and keeping it healthy. It covers planning/requirements, design, coding, integration, release, and maintenance.

Software Testing Life Cycle(STLC): The quality side of the same journey how we plan tests, design scenarios, prepare data/environments, run checks (functional, API/UI, performance, security), track defects, and decide if it’s safe to ship.

Differences between SDLC and STLC:

Goal:
SDLC: deliver working software that solves a problem.
STLC: give trustworthy proof that the software is ready and risks are understood.

Scope:
SDLC: everything from idea to operations.
STLC: everything about quality inside that timeline.

Timing:
SDLC kicks off with a validated need and a backlog.
STLC starts as soon as requirements are clear enough to test against, and runs in parallel.

Outputs:
SDLC: user stories, designs, source code, builds, releases, runbooks.
STLC: test strategy/plan, mapped scenarios/cases, automation suites, defect reports, a final quality summary.

Ownership:
SDLC: product, architects, dev, DevOps/SRE, security, QA—everyone.
STLC: QA/testing leads it, with input from product/dev/DevOps/security.

Decision:
SDLC asks: “Does this meet the business goal and can we run it?”
STLC asks: “Do results meet our exit criteria—coverage, severity thresholds, performance/security targets?”

Metrics:
SDLC: lead time, deployment frequency, change failure rate, MTTR.
STLC: requirements coverage, automated coverage, pass/fail trends, defect density/escape rate, flake rate.

Typical failure modes:
SDLC-heavy, STLC-light: ships on time, breaks on edge cases.
STLC without SDLC context: green tests that miss what the business cares about.
